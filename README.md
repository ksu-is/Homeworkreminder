# Homeworkreminder
Make a program to where you can set a time into the software and one the links you put into the system pops up. I can set it in the program, and then go onto the computer and then when the time comes for the alarm to go off, the assignment link automatically pops up. The assignment link comes up at random, it sorts through all of the imported links when the alarm goes off. Then it sends you the link to work on. The idea is to set the links in the morning and times and then throughout the idea, you get work done without being overwhelmed. A lot of the times. It also creates interest into what assignment is going to pop up at the time. Links only pop up once, so with each alarm that goes off, you will not get the same assignment link. Once all but one link has been pulled up with an alarm, the same link will continue to show up for the rest of the 24-hour schedule.
